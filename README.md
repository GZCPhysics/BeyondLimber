# BeyondLimber

These are the Python scripts for calculation based on our approximation

Major functioning scripts are:
1. Decomposition.py
2. Cosmology.py
3. Calculation.py
4. Calculation_RSD.py

The method of using these scripts are described in example.ipynb

The pre-caclulated full-sky and Limber data are stored in:
1. Full-sky (.txt type for clustering, .npy type for RSD)

Required the packages are: 
### numpy, scipy, mpmath, Colossus, pyCAMB, CLASS.

The choice of cosmology related functions could be replaced with anything users are familiar with.

Also there are flexibility of changing the choice of window functions.
